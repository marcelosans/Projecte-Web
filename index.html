                    <p>Frog began his life as Glenn, the squire to Cyrus, who served as Knight-Captain to King Guardia XXI.
                       Glenn always looked up to the older warrior as a mentor and "big brother" figure, as they had been close childhood friends
                        -- Glenn had been picked on as a child and refused to fight back for fear he would hurt the offending kids.
                         Glenn accompanied Cyrus on his journey to the Denadoro Mts and helped retrieve the mythical Masamune from its resting place atop the mountain peak.
                          Prior to this, the two recovered the Badge of Courage from the Frog King. 
                      Ozzie and Magus attacked the pair in the mountains, and the dark wizard killed Cyrus outright; his last words to Glenn were to take care of Queen Leene. </p>
